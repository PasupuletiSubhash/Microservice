# paymentservice

## Application Overview:
The application described by the Dockerfile is a Node.js backend service that likely utilizes gRPC for communication. The service is optimized for production deployment with a focus on performance and monitoring.

## Technology Stack:
### Node.js: 
Version 20.2.0, backend runtime.
### Dependencies:
npm for production packages, python3, make, g++ for builds.
### gRPC:
Service communication on port 50051, with grpc_health_probe for monitoring.


# Docker File Explain
The application is a Node.js backend service optimized for production deployment. It utilizes a multi-stage build process to install necessary dependencies and application code, and it incorporates tools for monitoring service health, particularly for gRPC. The use of a lightweight Alpine-based image ensures a minimal and secure runtime environment.

### Base Image:
Node.js 20.2.0 on Alpine Linux.
### Builder Stage:
Installs python3, make, and g++.Copies package.json and package-lock.json. Installs production dependencies.
### Final Stage:
Copies dependencies and application code. Exposes port 50051. Sets entry point to node index.js.
### gRPC Health Probe:
Adds grpc_health_probe tool for gRPC monitoring.

# Jenkins File Explain
This Jenkins Pipeline script automates the build and push process for a Docker image. It uses Docker registry credentials (docker-cred) and the Docker CLI (docker) tool to build an image tagged as mamir32825/paymentservice:latest and subsequently push it to a Docker registry. The stages ensure that the Docker image is built and tagged correctly before being deployed or used further in the CI/CD pipeline.
