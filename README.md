# Cart service app explain
This indicates the application is a backend service built with .NET, utilizing ASP.NET Core, designed to run in a containerized environment with gRPC support.

### Framework: 
ASP.NET Core (suggested by the use of ASPNETCORE_URLS)
### Technology Stack
The application is a backend service built using C# and ASP.NET Core, running on .NET Core. It is containerized using Docker, with a lean runtime environment based on Alpine Linux. The application leverages gRPC for communication and uses the dotnet CLI for build and dependency management.


# Docker file explain
This Dockerfile is designed to build, optimize, and deploy a .NET application using a multi-stage build process, which helps reduce the final image size and enhance security.

Multi-Stage Build Process
### Build and Optimize: 
Using a full .NET SDK for building and publishing the application.
### Runtime Efficiency: 
Using a minimal runtime image to run the published application, ensuring a smaller and more secure final image.
### Add Health Probes: 
Adding tools like gRPC health probe in a secure manner by leveraging root privileges temporarily.

Jenkins File Explanation:
This Jenkins Pipeline script automates the build and push process for a Docker image. It uses Docker registry credentials (docker-cred) and the Docker CLI (docker) tool to build an image tagged as mamir32825/cartservice:latest and subsequently push it to a Docker registry. The stages ensure that the Docker image is built and tagged correctly before being deployed or used further in the CI/CD pipeline.
